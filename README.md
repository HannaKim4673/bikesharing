# NYC CitiBike-sharing Program Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The main goal of this analysis was to create a Tableau story using data collected from a NYC bike-sharing program that would convince investors that opening a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good business opportunity that should have their support. In order to do this, the data was used to create 7 visualizations that showed the popularity of starting locations in NYC, the popularity of ending locations in NYC, how long bikes were used, how long each gender group used the bikes, how often and when bikes were used on each day of the week, how often and when each gender group used the bikes on each day of the week, and how often and when each user type used the bikes on each day of the week. After these visualizations were made, they were put together into a Tableau story that can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14Challenge_16241483567880/NYCBikeTripAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Results

### Visualization 1: Top Starting Locations

The above visualization shows how often NYC CitiBike starting locations are used. An interactive version of this visualization can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14Challenge_16241483567880/TopStartingLocations?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Given that a majority of the darker, larger circles are clustered around the Manhattan area, this figure suggests that starting locations in Manhattan are the most popular amongst Citibike users in NYC. This result may be due to the fact that there are many tourists that go to visit Manhattan. In turn, this suggests that it would be prudent to set up bike starting locations in popular tourist areas in Des Moines.
